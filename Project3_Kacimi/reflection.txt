After revising the HTML form, The most important changes I made to the form is correcting the method="Delete" to method="POST" 
since HTML forms only support GET and POST. using DELETE would prevent the browser from submitting the form properly

 I applied validation rulesbased on the nature of each input. For example, the usename and password fileds are marked as "required" with
"maxlength" and "minlength" constraints. The age field uses type="number" with minimum and maximum values. The email field uses type="email".
Also, I added a JavaSxript function to limit input to only 10 words as stated.

As far as security is concerned, the visibility and behaior of the password field. It used a non-standard class hiden-password missing 
a proper type which is could expose sensitive data. I corrected it by using type="password" and adding autocomplete="new-password" to prevent 
autofilling.

If this were a live production form, I would implement SSL/TLS encryption to comply with privacy laws and annonymizing user data to prevent malicous
attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting, and spam bots by implementing CAPTCHA.
